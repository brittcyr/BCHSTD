			<h4>About Us</h4>
			Fantasy Politics is a 6.470 project. It was developed in January, 2012. The goal of Fantasy Politics is to encourage an interest in politics. Most people (myself included) are not very politically informed. We hope that when we throw a little competition into the mix, more people will be inspired to read up on candidates in order to make an educated selection. To win.
